want to make the change yourself or are proposing it for another contributer or maintainer.

After discussion and review, a maintainer will mark the issue as approved or denied. If it's approved,
either you will be assigned to the issue (if you indicated you would like to be) or someone else can
request to be assigned.

Once someone is assigned, they can move on to Making Changes (below).
