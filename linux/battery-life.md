# Linux Battery Life Tweaks
This page is intended to replace the [Linux Battery Life Forum Thread](https://community.frame.work/t/linux-battery-life-tuning/6665), which is difficult to navigate and has some misleading information in it. If (or when) Framework releases official guides for this information, this page will be removed and replaced with a link to it. 

## Basic Tweaks
### Power Monitoring with Powertop

### Expansion Cards Selection

### Display and Keyboard Brightness

### Power Management With TLP

#### Disabling Turbo Boost


## Advanced Tweaks (Coming Soon)
